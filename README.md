## Summary

This is a simple and minimal php application for complains.
It was written according to this [assignment](assignment.md).

## How to use?
> Note, you should have latest php installed. Problems with `empty()` for versions < 5.

First you'll need to have Apache and MySQL installed on your system. Optionally git.
Create a MySQL database then put the [data.sql](data.sql) tables.

If you have git simply navigate to your `htdocs` directory and run  
`$ git clone https://github.com/vasspilka/complain.git` .  
After the repository is copied just modify [variables.php](variables.php) with your custom variables.

Otherwise download this repository as a [zip](https://github.com/vasspilka/complain/archive/master.zip), place it to `htdocs`, extract it,
and then modify [variables.php](variables.php).
